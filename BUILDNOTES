1) Consider upgrading CXX test to use the more modern version (srs9)
2) No more gcc extensions
3) Consider not running tests unless flag is added
4) Remove CGI depends/incorrect references
5) Cuda dynamic object lookup shouldn't include cuda version name (will require user to symlink their cudart)
6) Get rid of all warnings
7) Add -Werror && other warning flags (highest level of warnings possible)
8) Add support for git modules so app is properly bundled together as one standalone product (add boost, opencv, gdal)
9) Add debug build supprt (for CUDA too)
