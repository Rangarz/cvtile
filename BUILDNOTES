1) Consider upgrading CXX test to use the more modern version (srs9)
2) No more gcc extensions
3) Consider not running tests unless flag is added
4) Remove CGI depends/incorrect references
5) Add support for git modules so app is properly bundled together as one standalone product (add boost, opencv, gdal)
6) Add debug build supprt (for CUDA too)
